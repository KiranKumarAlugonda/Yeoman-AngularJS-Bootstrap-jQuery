Yeoman-AngularJS-Bootstrap-jQuery
=================================

An empty AngularJS starter project made through Yeoman. Uses Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 CDN, AngularJS CDN 1.1.5, as well as jQuery CDN 2.0.3


*I made this one because creating a default project on Windows Operating System through NPM using Yeoman and AngularJS results in dozens of errors and lost dependencies.*
